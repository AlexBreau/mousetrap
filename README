MouseTrap v0.3

Introduction
========================================================================

MouseTrap is a free Open Source mouse pointer controller by using a low
cost web cam and good face points to track.

MouseTrap works with applications and toolkits that support the assistive
technology service provider interface (AT-SPI), which is the primary
assistive technology infrastructure for the Solaris and Linux
operating environments.  Applications and toolkits supporting the
AT-SPI include the GNOME GTK+ toolkit, the Java platform's Swing
toolkit, OpenOffice, and Mozilla.  AT-SPI support for the KDE Qt
toolkit is currently being pursued.

information on MouseTrap, including how to run MouseTrap, how to communicate
with the MouseTrap user community, and where to log bugs and feature
requests.


Build Requirements
========================================================================

Building MouseTrap also requires the development modules for the following
to be installed:


* Python  >= 2.4              - Python platform
* pyorbit >= 2.14.0           - Python bindings for ORBit2
* pygtk   >= 2.8.4            - GTK+ Python bindings
* Opencv  >= 0.9.9            - Open Computer Vision Library

YOU ALSO NEED THE LATEST AT-SPI, ATK, AND GAIL FOR THE GNOME 2.23.x
DEVELOPMENT RELEASES.  THEY CONTAIN VERY IMPORTANT BUG FIXES!

NOTE: If you have multiple versions of the python interpreter installed
on your machine, you should set the PYTHON environment variable when 
configuring MouseTrap.  For example:

   PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.4 ./autogen.sh

or

   PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.4 ./configure

NOTE FOR BRLTTY USERS:

Running MouseTrap
========================================================================

To run MouseTrap, you have several options:

1) Enable accessibility and the screen reader via the
   "System->Preferences->Assistive Technology Preferences"
   dialog box (also available as the 'gnome-at-properties'
   application).  As of GNOME 2.16, this will cause MouseTrap to
   be automatically launched when you log in.

3) Select "MouseTrap" from the 
   Applications->Accessibility launch menu (also available as
   the 'mousetrap' application).  This will run MouseTrap once.

4) Press Alt+F2 to bring up the "Run Application" dialog
   box.  Enter "mousetrap" and press Return.  This will run
   MouseTrap once.

5) Run the "mousetrap" command from a virtual console or 
   gnome-terminal window.  This will run MouseTrap once.
